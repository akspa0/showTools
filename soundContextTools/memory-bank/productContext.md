**Purpose:**
Why this project exists, the problems it solves, how it should work, and user experience goals.

## Problem Statement

Editing and contextualizing raw phone call audio is tedious, error-prone, and privacy-sensitive. Manual workflows are slow and do not scale for dataset creation or advanced analysis.

## Solution Overview

Automate the ingestion, PII removal, file tracking, and AI-based processing of phone call audio. Use state-of-the-art models for separation, annotation, normalization, and diarization, with robust file management.

## User Experience Goals

- Simple, automated processing of large batches of audio
- Privacy-first: no PII in filenames or outputs
- Clear traceability of files through all steps
- Output ready for further analysis or dataset use
