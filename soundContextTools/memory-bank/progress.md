**Purpose:**
Tracks what works, what's left to build, current status, and known issues.

## What Works

- All pipeline stages (ingestion, separation, CLAP, diarization, normalization, transcription, soundbite, remix, show, logging/manifest, LLM integration) are implemented and robust
- Privacy, manifest, and logging requirements are strictly enforced by the PipelineOrchestrator
- LLM and CLAP integration is complete, with master transcript and event merging
- Defensive code and error handling are in place for malformed or missing data
- System is fully auditable, extensible, and user-configurable
- **Finalization stage in progress:**
  - MP3 conversion for all soundbites and show audio (192kbps VBR)
  - Embedding full metadata/lineage in ID3 tags (call index, speaker, timestamps, transcript, LLM titles, etc.)
  - LLM-driven show title and description (family-friendly, comedic, fallback to default if invalid)
  - Show MP3 and .txt description named after LLM show title, fallback to completed-show.mp3 if needed
  - Manifest and logs updated with all finalized outputs and metadata
  - Two-stage LLM workflow: per-call titles/synopses, then show-level title/description

## What's Left to Build

- Complete and test finalization stage for MP3 outputs and metadata
- Ensure robust fallback logic for LLM output
- Ongoing documentation and memory bank updates as the project evolves

## Current Status

Pipeline is fully functional, privacy-focused, robust, and extensible. Finalization stage for MP3 outputs and show-level LLM metadata is in progress. Ready for production use and further user-driven improvements.

## Known Issues

- None (all known issues addressed; continue monitoring as new features are added)
