## Pattern: Final Output Builder as Last Step
- The final_output_builder.py is always invoked as the last step of the pipeline.
- It produces a robust, user-facing output folder with all required files, metadata, and a zipped archive.
- All lineage, tagging, and extensibility requirements are met.
- Next focus: advanced content moderation, show-level LLM synopses, and UI integration for LLM tasks.
